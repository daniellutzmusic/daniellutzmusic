☆ sī-dîr′ē-əl Blues ☆
-->Daniel Lutz
Singer/Songwriter, Musician, Composer
	I'm an ariose missionary—a logger of wisdom pearls. 
  My music inspires a sense of old-world exploration 
  and a mediatation on the deep future. Thru song I am 
  grasping for eternal truths that can be held in the 
  palm of your soul. I seek to reconcile opposing forces—
  the realm of towering dreams and primordial nightmares—
  the exquisite and the homely—the enlightening and 
  the paralyzing—for the ideal listener, these battles 
  will transfer visual collages of the fiercest and most 
  adventurous kind. My desire is to create timeless music 
  and to inspire timeless pursuits in others. I make music 
  that is closer to God. My music is an expression of 
  longing for a golden age where beauty, truth and 
  goodness reign supreme. My music will inpsire lost 
  souls to seek God and discover world in tune—however fleeting.
