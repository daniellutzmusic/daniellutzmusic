☆ sī-dîr′ē-əl Blues ☆
-->Daniel Lutz
Singer/Songwriter, Musician, Composer
	I'm an ariose missionary—a logger of wisdom pearls— 
  my music inspires a sense of old-world exploration 
  and extraterrestrial yearning. Thru song I am 
  grasping for eternal truths that can be held in the 
  palm of your soul. I seek to reconcile opposing forces——
  the realm of towering dreams and primordial nightmares,
  the exquisite and the homely, the enlightening and 
  the paralyzing. For my ideal audience, these battles 
  will transfer visual collages of the most uncanny and timeless adventures. 
  My desire is to create timeless music and to inspire 
  the pursuit of the timeless in others. I make music that is 
  closer to God. My music is an expression of longing 
  for a golden age where beauty, truth and goodness 
  reign supreme. My music will inpsire lost souls to 
  seek God and discover a world in tune——however fleeting.
